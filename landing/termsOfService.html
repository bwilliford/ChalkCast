        </ul>

        <h3 class="true-teal">Agreement to Terms</h3>
        <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. </p>
        <p>The Service that ChalkCast provides is always evolving and the form and nature of the Service may change from time to time without prior notice to you. In addition, ChalkCast may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Service (or any features within the Service) to you or to users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice.

        <h3 class="true-teal">Registration</h3>
        <p>If you want to use certain features of the Service, you must create an account and become a registered user (“User”).
