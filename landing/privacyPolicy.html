        <h3 class="true-teal">ChalkCast Privacy Policy Principles</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>We promise to create a safe and secure environment for students and teachers of all ages.</li>
            <li>We do not require you to provide any Personal Information in order to join a class session, which is accessible without a user account. </li>
            <li>Privacy drives product design, and we consciously avoid personal information unless it improves the product experience for you.</li>

            <li>We do not sell any information, personal or otherwise, to third parties.</li>
            <li>We do not display advertising or promotional material of any kind on ChalkCast.</li>

        <h3 class="true-teal">What information do we collect, and how do we use it?</h3>

        <p>On occasion, we collect student and teacher testimonials to promote our learning philosophy.

        <p>If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you such as your name, email address, phone number, the contents of the message and/or attachments you may send us, and any other information you may choose to provide.</p>

        <h3 class="true-teal">No Commercial Use of Student Data</h3>
        <p>We do not sell ads or Personal Information, or use Personal Information for financial gain. Per the Student Online Personal Information Protection Act (SOPIPA), ChalkCast does not use, disclose, or compile any student Personal Information for the purpose of marketing or advertising commercial products or services.

        <h3 class="true-teal">Technical Data</h3>
        <p>To provide the best user experience, we may use various technologies to remember your past activity and provide you with a more streamlined process.</p>
        <p>For example, whether or not you have a ChalkCast account, when you use ChalkCast for the first time, we send a token that is stored in your browser’s local storage, so that we can tie all future ChalkCast sessions back to you.</p>

        <h3 class="true-teal">Updates</h3>
        <p>As we add more features to our services, our Privacy Policy will change. However, we will not change how we use any Personal Information we have already collected in any material way without also providing notice of the change and obtaining user consent, or the consent from a school or district, if applicable.</p>
        <p>As soon as we implement changes, we will notify users about updates. Within 24 hours of an update, we will post the revised Privacy Policy to our website, and display a notification banner on our homepage, on our sign up page, and any other place on our site we deem to have high traffic. For any significant changes to our policy, we will also contact users directly via email if their email address has been explicitly shared with ChalkCast.</p>
        <p>In addition, ChalkCast will maintain a changelog that will document a list of notable changes by date to make it easier for users to track when and what changes were made.</p>
